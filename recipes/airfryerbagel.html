        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a fork, mix flour and Greek yogurt together in a medium bowl until a crumbly dough forms. If mixture is too thick, add a little more yogurt or if too sticky, add a bit more flour.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface, and knead until smooth, 5 to 7 minutes. Divide the dough evenly into 4 balls, rolling and stretching each into 3/4-inch thick ropes that are about 8- to 9-inches long. Connect both ends, pinching and sealing to form a bagel. Brush with egg white, and sprinkle with bagel seasoning.</li>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 280 degrees F (137 degrees C). Line the fryer basket with a parchment liner or spray lightly with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Place the bagels in the basket, and cook until golden brown, 15 to 16 minutes. Do not crowd the basket, and cook in two batches if your air fryer is small.</li>
        </ol>
